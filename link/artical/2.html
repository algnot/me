        <b>What is nosql?</b> <br>
        When people use the term “NoSQL database”, they typically use it to refer to any non-relational database. Some say the term “NoSQL” stands for “non SQL” while others say it stands for “not only SQL.” Either way, most agree that NoSQL databases are databases that store data in a format other than relational tables.
        <br><br>
        A common misconception is that NoSQL databases or non-relational databases don’t store relationship data well. NoSQL databases can store relationship data—they just store it differently than relational databases do. In fact, when compared with SQL databases, many find modeling relationship data in NoSQL databases to be easier than in SQL databases, because related data doesn’t have to be split between tables.
        <br><br>
        NoSQL data models allow related data to be nested within a single data structure.
        <br><br>
        NoSQL databases emerged in the late 2000s as the cost of storage dramatically decreased. Gone were the days of needing to create a complex, difficult-to-manage data model simply for the purposes of reducing data duplication. Developers (rather than storage) were becoming the primary cost of software development, so NoSQL databases optimized for developer productivity.
        <br><br>
        As storage costs rapidly decreased, the amount of data applications needed to store and query increased. This data came in all shapes and sizes—structured, semistructured, and polymorphic—and defining the schema in advance became nearly impossible. NoSQL databases allow developers to store huge amounts of unstructured data, giving them a lot of flexibility.
        <br><br>
        Additionally, the Agile Manifesto was rising in popularity, and software engineers were rethinking the way they developed software. They were recognizing the need to rapidly adapt to changing requirements. They needed the ability to iterate quickly and make changes throughout their software stack—all the way down to the database model. NoSQL databases gave them this flexibility.
        <br><br>
        Cloud computing also rose in popularity, and developers began using public clouds to host their applications and data. They wanted the ability to distribute data across multiple servers and regions to make their applications resilient, to scale-out instead of scale-up, and to intelligent geo-place their data. Some NoSQL databases like MongoDB provided these capabilities.
